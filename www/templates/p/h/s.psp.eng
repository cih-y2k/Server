OVERVIEW_HEADING Overview

OVERVIEW_INTRO \
\
The Search Engine provides an ability to compose expressions for searching posts by words and phrases they contain, \
as well as by some attributes they have, like feed, site, domain, country, language, \
topic, category, publication or fetch date. Expression consist from operations classified as \
<a href="#BASE_OPS">basic</a>, <a href="#LOGIC_OPS">logical</a> and \
<a href="#RESTRICTING_OPS">restrictive</a>. Basic operations return lists of posts by specific keys such as word, source or site. \
The set of basic operations is derived from data structure of the system. Logical operations allows \
to combine expressions uniting, intersecting search results or excluding one result from another. \
Restrictive operations narrow down result set filtering posts by specific criteria.

BASE_OPERATORS_HEADING Basic operations

BASE_OPERATORS_INTRO \
\
<a href="#ALL">ALL</a>, <a href="#ANY">ANY</a>, <a href="#CATEGORY">CATEGORY</a>, <a href="#EVERY">EVERY</a>, <a href="#SITE">SITE</a>, <a href="#URL">URL</a> <span class="op_form">basic operations</span> intended for searching posts by \
words they contain or by source location news posts come from.

ALL_SEARCH \
\
<span class="op_def">Operation ALL</span> have the <span class="op_form">ALL modifier ... term ...</span> form where \
<span class="op_form">term</span> is a word or a phrase taken into double or single quotes. \
Operation return just those posts which contain all specified terms. Presence of optional modifier <span class="op_form">CORE</span> mean that only post "important" words should be considered. \
<span class="op_form">Positional</span> modifiers <span class="op_form">TITLE, DESCRIPTION, IMAGE-ALT, KEYWORDS</span> define in which post parts found terms should be present: <span class="op_form">TITLE</span> - in title, <span class="op_form">DESCRIPTION</span> - in annotation, <span class="op_form">IMAGE-ALT</span> - in explanatory text for an image, <span class="op_form">KEYWORDS</span> - in automatically created invisible list of words characterizing a post. If no positioning operators provided then <span class="op_form">TITLE, DESCRIPTION</span> and <span class="op_form">IMAGE-ALT</span> assumed to be present implicitly. \
Operation name declaration is optional. \
If enter only search terms or start with just modifiers then Search Engine will "guess" that word ALL is assumed at the beginning. Search is performed with \
no respect to character case, this why <span class="inline_example">fly Moon</span> and <span class="inline_example">fly moon</span> \
searches give the same result. Search is performed with no respect to word forms as well, so <span class="inline_example">tournament winner</span> and \
<span class="inline_example">tournaments winners</span> searches are identical. When you search for phrases, Search Engine will display \
only those posts which have no punctuation marks between words inside a phrase being searched. \
There is a difference between taking search phrases into single or double quotes. \
When phrase is double quoted then words should appear in posts in exactly same \
form to be found. When phrase is single quoted then word form is not taken into account. \
So 'space shuttle' will find all 3 phrases:<br>... the space shuttle \
Atlantis ... all space shuttles ... space shuttle's fuel tank ...<br>\
while "space shuttle" will find only the first phrase. Quoted phrase will match to post in presense of CORE modifier \
if at least one word contained in phrase belong to set of post "important" words. \
Usage examples:

ALL_SEARCH_SAMPLES \
\
asteroid<br>\
'space shuttle'<br>\
TITLE "solar system" research<br>\
ALL solar system<br>\
ALL CORE rocket 'launch failed'<br>\
ALL TITLE DESCRIPTION rocket

ANY_SEARCH \
\
<span class="op_def">Operation ANY</span> have the <span class="op_form">ANY (threshold)? modifier ... term ...</span> form and differs from ALL \
with one thing - it find posts containing not all but at least some of listed terms in quantity not less than threshold specified (1 by default). \
Usage examples:

ANY_SEARCH_SAMPLES \
\
ANY meteorite comet<br>\
ANY 2 astronaut "space shuttle" "progress M-60"<br>\
ANY 2 CORE moon mars jupiter saturn<br>\
ANY 2 CORE TITLE KEYWORDS moon mars jupiter saturn

URL_SEARCH \
\
<span class="op_def">Operation URL</span> have the <span class="op_form">URL source url...</span> form and \
return posts from sources specified. Usage examples:

URL_SEARCH_SAMPLES \
\
URL http://n.y.com/z<br>\
URL y.ru/a y.ru/b

SITE_SEARCH \
\
<span class="op_def">Operation SITE</span> have the <span class="op_form">SITE source site...</span> form and \
return posts from sources belonging to sites specified. Usage examples:

SITE_SEARCH_SAMPLES \
\
SITE news.yahoo.com prw.com<br>\
SITE news.yandex.ru

CATEGORY_SEARCH \
\
<span class="op_def">Operation CATEGORY</span> have the <span class="op_form">CATEGORY category path...</span> form and \
returns posts attributed to any of categories specified. Leading and trailing slashes in category path are optional. \
If category path contains space character you need to take the path into quotes otherwise it will \
be interpreted as 2 separate paths. Usage examples:

CATEGORY_SEARCH_SAMPLES \
\
CATEGORY /Science/Astronomy Science/Biology/<br>\
CATEGORY "/Sport/Model Aircraft" Science

EVERY_SEARCH \
\
<span class="op_def">Operation EVERY</span> return posts from all sources. \
Usage examples:

EVERY_SEARCH_SAMPLES \
\
EVERY<br>\
EVERY DOMAIN ru

LOGIC_OPERATORS_HEADING Logical operations

LOGIC_OPERATORS_INTRO \
\
Besides <span class="op_form">basic operations</span> there are <span class="op_form">logical operations</span> <a href="#AND">AND</a>, <a href="#EXCEPT">EXCEPT</a>, \
<a href="#OR">OR</a> which allow to specify more complex searches - so called \
<span class="op_form">search expressions</span>. Strictly saying basic operations are \
search expressions as well, though trivial ones.

AND_SEARCH \
\
<span class="op_def">Operation AND</span> have the <span class="op_form">search expression AND search expression</span> form and return posts \
which have been found for left and right search expressions simultaneously. \
Usage examples:

AND_SEARCH_SAMPLES \
\
ANY meteorite comet AND SITE msn.com<br>\
rocket AND ANY space canaveral

OR_SEARCH \
\
<span class="op_def">Operation OR</span> have the <span class="op_form">search expression OR search expression</span> form and return posts \
which have been found for left or right search expression. Usage examples:

OR_SEARCH_SAMPLES \
\
SITE ya.com OR URL pr.com/x<br>\
space research OR ANY astronaut spaceship "space shield"

EXCEPT_SEARCH \
\
<span class="op_def">Operation EXCEPT</span> have the <span class="op_form">search expression EXCEPT search expression</span> form and return \
just those posts which have been found for left search expression but not for the right one. \
Usage examples:

EXCEPT_SEARCH_SAMPLES \
\
virus EXCEPT ANY computer phone program<br>\
SITE c.com EXCEPT URL http://c.com/z

LOGIC_OPERATORS_PRECEDENCE \
\
Search expressions containing not only base operations are called <span class="op_form">compound</span>. \
They get evaluated in the order of operation priority decrease and from the left \
to the right for operations with the same priority. Evaluation order can be changed \
by means of parenthesis. AND and EXCEPT have equal priority, which is higher \
than that of OR operation. \
<div style="padding: 0.3em 0;">This why</div> \
\
<span class="inline_example">comet AND SITE rss.msnbc.msn.com OR rocket AND ANY space canaveral</span>\
\
<div style="padding: 0.3em 0;">is equivalent to</div>\
\
<span class="inline_example">( comet AND SITE rss.msnbc.msn.com ) OR ( rocket AND ANY space canaveral ).</span>
