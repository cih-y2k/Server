The  purpose of this document is to provide instructions for preparing a setup 
that can be used to develop the NewsGate Server. 

By now the development binary package (containing the reqired compile and 
runtime  dependencies for Elements) is installed, Elements library is built.
The directory tree structure is suposed to be the following:

~/projects
  Elements
  NewsGate
    Server
    SiteConfig
    Workspace

If by some reason you decide to change the directories structure the following
instructions and configuration files must be changed respectivelly.


Compilation
-----------

Clone the Server and change the current directory to the project's one.

$ cd ~/projects
$ mkdir NewsGate
$ cd NewsGate
$ git clone git@github.com:newsgate/Server.git
$ cd Server

Run OpenSBE script which creates configure script.

osbe

Create the build output directory as well as default.config file with the 
compilation options that should be used for the build. You can use cpp 
preprocessor to generate such a configuration file from default.config.t 
template passing some controlling macros to the preprocessor (read comments in
default.config.t for details). You can also adjust specific compile options
in the generated configuration file.

$ mkdir build

$ cpp -DDEBUG -DARC_x86_64 -DORB_TAO -DELEMENTS_SRC=$HOME/projects/Elements \
  -DELEMENTS_BUILD=$HOME/projects/Elements/build default.config.t > \
  ./build/default.config


Now you can generate Makefiles corresponding to your compile options.

cd build
../configure --enable-no-questions=yes

make -j8


Configuration
-------------

Clone the Server configuration and change the current directory to the 
project's one.

$ cd ~/projects/NewsGate
$ mkdir SiteConfig

[ Template cloning instructions. ]

$ cd Template

Run OpenSBE script which creates configure script.

osbe

$ mkdir build
$ cd build

@@ For some reason configure script doesn't work properly in the interactive
   (default) mode. Should be some osbe bug.

@@ Create set of default.config files (from minimal to more advanced) which can 
   be used as templates. Or maybe create default.config,t supporting some small
   number of parameters which allows to create some basic configurations.

Create default.config file and run configure.

$ ../configure --enable-no-questions=yes

$ make install destdir=~/projects/NewsGate proddir=/Workspace \
  sysconfdir=/Workspace/etc

$ cp ~/projects/NewsGate/Server/VERSION \
  ~/projects/NewsGate/Workspace/etc/NewsGate


Management
----------

$ cd ~/projects/NewsGate/Workspace/etc
$ ./newsgate.sh start

The first start is slower than the next ones as the management script creates
the database on the first run.

$ ./newsgate.sh status
$ lynx localhost:7180 # End-user WEB interface.
$ lynx localhost:7181 # Admin WEB interface (username admin, pass admin).

$ ./newsgate.sh stop
