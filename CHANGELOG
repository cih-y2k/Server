    increased to 2.3 from 2, word frequency countd with pow(1.3) factor.
  * Number words in event decreased from 12 to 10, but intersection requirement
    descreased from 7 to 6 words.

Changes with NewsGate 1.1.3.0 (3 Dec 2007)
  * 1-level domain of feed url considered in the first turn while determining
    country code.
  * CAPACITY operator implemented.
  * Event words max count decreased to 12 from 15 to increase number of cases
    when too different messages get mixed in same event.

Changes with NewsGate 1.1.2.1 (25 Nov 2007)
  * Search frontend prints more event related info in Debug Mode

Changes with NewsGate 1.1.2.0 (23 Nov 2007)
  * "Similar posts" link implemented
  * Image presense amend message match weight with a small factor.

Changes with NewsGate 1.1.1.0 (15 Nov 2007)
  * Message::Id made to be unsigned long long, calculated as a CRC of 
    message url.
  * Events persistence completed.
  * StoredMessage::event_id now updated on message merge.

Changes with NewsGate 1.1.0.3 (8 Nov 2007)
  * Bug fixed.
  * Events merging algorithm changed again to increase performance futher.

Changes with NewsGate 1.1.0.2 (4 Nov 2007)
  * Events persistence implemented.
  * Events merging algorithm changed to increase performance.

Changes with NewsGate 1.1.0.1 (31 Oct 2007)
  * EventBank modified: on insert always new event is created for each new 
    message; merge can happen only in merge_events function.
  * event_id added into StoredMessage structure.

Changes with NewsGate 1.1.0.0 (28 Oct 2007)
  * First version of EventBank created, partly functional but need to evaluate
    quality and performance.
  * In WEB interface msg.content->published replaced with msg.updated to avoid
    situation when sorted by date messages appears to be unsorted.
  * Debug version with (-ggdb -no-inline -O3) to catch issue with RSSPuller.
    Sometimes hangs.

Changes with NewsGate 1.0.4.4 (12 Oct 2007)
  * Debug version with (-ggdb -no-inline -O1) to catch issue with RSSPuller.
    Sometimes hangs.

Changes with NewsGate 1.0.4.3 (5 Oct 2007)

  * Weight components now are in range [0-1000] ( [0-100] before ) to increase 
    resolution.

  * TOPICALITY_WEIGHT changed to 5 from 2

  * Change word-in-message weight calculation in 
    SearcheableMessageMap::calc_words_freq:

    // position_weight * position_weight is to accent on words with
    // positions close to message top
    wi.weight = word_occurance * pow(position_weight, 1.3) / frequency;
    
    from

    wi.weight = word_occurance * position_weight / frequency;

Changes with NewsGate 1.0.4.2 (4 Oct 2007)

  * Add weightening by topicality
     // Calculating topicality component. Stronger than date-based but
     // weaker then match level. Allows to emphasize on fresh news.
     wmi.wid.weight += freshness * freshness * freshness / 10000 *
       TOPICALITY_WEIGHT;

Changes with NewsGate 1.0.4.1 (3 Oct 2007)

  * Changing weightening by coreness from

    (1.0 + msg.core_words.size() - index) / msg.core_words.size()
    to
    (float)(msg.core_words.size() - index) / sort_by_relevance->max_core_words

    So now to be first from 20 is much better than first from 5.

Changes with NewsGate 1.0.4.0 (1 Oct 2007)

  * Sorting search results by relevance implemented. 
    Relevance is a function of message core words match factor and 
    message pulishing time.

Changes with NewsGate 1.0.3.1 (18 Sep 2007)

  * SearcheableMessageMap::insert suppress duplicates based on message 
    signatures

Changes with NewsGate 1.0.3.0 (16 Sep 2007)

Changes with NewsGate 1.0.2.1 (6 Aug 2007)

  * Moved from word hash to message numbers mapping to word to message number 
    mapping.

Changes with NewsGate 1.0.2.0 (31 Jul 2007)

  * NewsGate::Message::StoredMessage and NewsGate::Message::StoredContent 
    classes moved to usage of El::String::SharedStringConstPtr for memory 
    consumption decrease.

Changes with NewsGate 1.0.1.2 (5 Jul 2007)

  * Bugfix: error in parsing separators at the end of word

Changes with NewsGate 1.0.1.1 (30 Jun 2007)

  * Bugfix: word frequency was calculated improperly
  * Bugfix: improper handling multiple quotes at the beginning of same word, 
            like "'ABC' xyz"
  * Bugfix: RSSPuller stops very slowly as some feeds download too long because
            of small TCP window size set.

Changes with NewsGate 1.0.1.0 (17 Jun 2007)

   * Word-length statistics in MessageBank (dumped on load).
   * Debug Info: display word frequencies (local/gloal). 
     Use d=1 parameter in search request.
   * Deal with round, square brackets and parenthesis(make them separators).
